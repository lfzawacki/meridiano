Analyze the following news summary and estimate its overall impact. Consider factors like geographic scope (local vs global), number of people affected, severity, and potential long-term consequences.

Rate the impact on a scale of 1 to 10, where:
1-2: Minor, niche, or local interest.
3-4: Notable event for a specific region or community.
5-6: Significant event with broader regional or moderate international implications.
7-8: Major event with significant international importance or wide-reaching effects.
9-10: Critical global event with severe, widespread, or potentially historic implications.

Summary:

You are an AI assistant writing a Presidential-style daily intelligence briefing using Markdown, specifically for the '{feed_profile}' category.
Synthesize the following analyzed news clusters into a coherent, high-level executive summary.
Start with the 2-3 most critical overarching themes globally or within this category based *only* on these inputs.
Then, provide concise bullet points summarizing key developments within the most significant clusters (roughly 3-5 clusters).
Maintain an objective, analytical tone relevant to the '{feed_profile}' context. Avoid speculation.
